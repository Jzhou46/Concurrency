# Concurrency
For this assignment, you are to write a simulation in which a number of threads access a group of shared buffers for both reading and writing purposes. Initially this will be done without the benefit of synchronization tools ( semaphores ) to illustrate the problems of race conditions, and then with the synchronization tools to solve the problems. ( A separate mutex will be used to coordinate writing to the screen. ) Optional enhancements allow for the use of pipes, message queues, and shared memory.
